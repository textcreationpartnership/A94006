#Strange news from Gravesend and Greenwich. being an exact and more full relation of two miraculous and monstrous fishes first discovered in Rainham Creek, and afterwards pursued by fishermen up the river of Thames, who with harping irons and fish-spears kill'd the biggest of them at Gravesend, which after thousands of people had view'd it, they hew'd in pieces and boyl'd in cauldrons for the oyl. The other was taken and kill'd at Greenwich, which being measured, was found to be one and twenty foot in length, and sixteen foot over. And likewise a less than either of these which was in company with them, which made his escape from the fishermen, and got away to sea again. This relation being attested by many thousands of eye-witnesses, which have seen them both.#
